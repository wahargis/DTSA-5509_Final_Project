An EDA, Classification, and Analysis of the UCI Heart Disease dataset

- Exploring the UCI Heart Disease dataset
- Identifying notable characteristics
- Predicting Heart Disease

# Objective and Motivation

The goal of this project is to predict the occurrence of heart disease in individuals based on a set of features related to their health and lifestyle. This project involves understanding the key factors that contribute to heart disease, which can be beneficial for healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and potential prevention.

We will explore the dataset, train a collection of classifiers, and compare model performances and results.
